Objectives: You must first seize the armory tents in the desert that the
UP-KO security watch force is stationed at. Once these have been captured
the doors to the mines can be opened by the laptop in the tents. Next you
must take out the SAM site on the cliffs above the sand. To destroy the SAM
site you must hack the computer on the SAM to enable the self-destruct 
sequence. Once the SAM is destroyed, you must make your way down into the caves
to the processing facility. Once there, initiate the self-destruct sequence
and RUN.
