Remington 1100 Sawed-Off

Ammo Capacity: 5 Shells
Rate of Fire: Slow, semi-auto
Damage: Ranged

This is a sawed off auto-loading 12 gauge
shotgun. It's great for close quarters
battles, but should never be used for long or 
even medium ranges. This is the "stick it up 
their ass and pull the trigger" gun. Watch 'em 
fly.

Picking up a second 1100 off the ground will
complete an akimbo set, allowing the user to
wield both at once.

Changing modes switches between which 1100
one has out. Each 1100 has an independent
clip, which can be used to ones advantage.
