Akimbo Remington 1100 Sawed-Offs

Ammo Capacity: 5 Shells X 2
Rate of Fire: Slow double shot, faster single
Damage: Ranged

These are two sawed off, auto-loading, 12 gauge
shotguns. They're great for close quarters
battles and when wielded correctly can fight
off entire squads at a choke point, but will not
be effective for long or even medium ranges. This 
is the "stick it up their ass and pull the trigger"
gun. Watch 'em fly.

Secondary fire will fire BOTH barrels but it
is very inaccurate and takes extra time to
fire ones next shot.

Changing modes switches between which 1100(s)
one has out. Each 1100 has an independent
clip, which can be used to ones advantage.
