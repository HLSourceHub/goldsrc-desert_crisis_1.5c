Alarms

Alarms can be set anywhere the user wishes.
They are triggered by enemies running though
their field of view. They look only for enemy 
movement, so team-mates will not trigger them.

When triggered, alarms also send a radio
location indicator to the owner of the alarm,
informing when the alarm has be tripped and
in what area of the map. This is very useful
for defending multiple areas simultaneously.

Example:
* Alarm Trigged (Grassy Knoll)

BEEP BEEP BEEP!
