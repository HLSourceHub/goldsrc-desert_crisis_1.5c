Akimbo Laser Pistols

Ammo Capacity: 10-12 blasts per charge
Rate of Fire: Fast, semi-auto
Damage: Medium-High

The Laser Pistols fire laser blasts, and can 
be charged by holding the fire button for shots 
that do more damage. It also doesn't have ammo 
but a charge bar in place of clips. This gun is 
reasonably accurate.

Secondary fire will fire both pistols at once 
but has a slower rate of fire then primary mode.

Changing modes will switch between akimbo and
a single pistol. Akimbo pistols charge the bar
faster than a single pistol, but a single pistol 
has greater accuracy. Both will only
charge while deployed.
