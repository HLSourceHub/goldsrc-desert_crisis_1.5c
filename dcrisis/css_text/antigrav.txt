Antigrav System

This enables the user to jump over buildings
in a single bound, among other things. When
activated with one's item key, it enhances the
jumping ability of the user and eliminates
damage incurred when impacting the ground at
high speeds.

All of this takes energy though, so the meter
must be monitored closely. The meter takes
time to recharge once depleted.
