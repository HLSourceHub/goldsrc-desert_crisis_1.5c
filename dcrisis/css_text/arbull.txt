Akimbo Raging Bull Model 444's

Clip Size: 6 Rounds X 2
Rate of Fire: Slow Semi-Auto
Damage: Very High

With very high damage and very 
accurate when fired singlely, these may be
the most deadly of the pistols. The drawbacks 
are a slow rate of fire and small clip.

Secondary fire will fire BOTH pistols but
extra time to fire ones next shot.

Changing modes switches between which raging
bull(s) one has out. Each raging bull has an
independent clip, which can be used to ones
advantage.
