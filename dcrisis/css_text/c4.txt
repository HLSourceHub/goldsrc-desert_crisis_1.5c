C4 High Explosives

This is two blocks of the high explosive C4, 
complete with remote detonation device. Drop 
these in high traffic areas, then wait for an
unsuspecting victim to stroll by.

Primary attack drops a c4 if none is out, or
detonates those that are already out.

Secondary attack drops a c4 even if one is
already deployed, allowing for the user to
place multiple blocks for added effect.
