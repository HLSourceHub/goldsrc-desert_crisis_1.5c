M61A1 Vulcan Chaingun

Ammo Capacity: 350 Rounds
Rate of Fire: 2400 RPM
Damage: Medium

The Minigun: 20mm shells of death being spewed
at an insane rate. Don't plan on sniping
anything with this, as it is dreadfully
inaccurate. This gun was designed with 
suppressive fire in mind.

Sustained fire will overheat the minigun, 
causing it to enter a cooldown mode for a
brief period of time to prevent the barrel
melting and ammo exploding. There is no
secondary fire.
