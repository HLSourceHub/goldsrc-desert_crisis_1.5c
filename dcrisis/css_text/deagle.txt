.357 Desert Eagle

Clip Size: 7 Rounds
Rate of Fire: Medium, semi-auto
Damage: High

The Desert Eagle has a rather fast rate of fire 
and high damage, but is not as accurate as the 
sig or matches. It certainly is not as deadly
as the Raging Bull. These bullets pack a
wallop though, so don't be fooled by its
downsides.

Picking up a second Desert Eagle off the
ground will complete an akimbo set. Allowing
the user to wield both at once.

Changing modes switches between which deagle
one has out. Each deagle has an independent
clip, which can be used to ones advantage.
