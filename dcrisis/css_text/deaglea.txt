Akimbo .357 Desert Eagle

Clip Size: 7 Rounds X 2
Rate of Fire: Medium Semi-Auto
Damage: High

The Desert Eagle has a rather fast rate of fire 
and high damage, but is not as accurate as the 
sig or matches. It certainly is not as deadly
as the Raging Bull. These bullets pack a
wallop though, so don't be fooled by its
downsides.

Secondary fire will fire BOTH pistols but
extra time to fire ones next shot.

Changing modes switches between which deagle(s)
one has out. Each deagle has an independent
clip, which can be used to ones advantage.
