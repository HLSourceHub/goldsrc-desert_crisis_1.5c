EM Sniper Rifle

Clip Size: 4 Shots
Rate of Fire: 25 RPM
Damage: Very High

The EM Sniper Rifle can be described as the 
ultimate sniping weapon. This weapon has
a low rate of fire compared to many of the other
guns. But what it lacks in speed, it more
than makes up for in power. When this weapon
fires, it instantly reaches its target. It not
only burns the flesh where it hits, but the
beam is so powerful and concentrated that the
air near the impact point becomes super heated
and temporarily reaches a plasma state. This
will severely damage the person and is almost
a guaranteed kill for targets with little
armor. This is not a weapon for people who
can't aim though, as your aim counts for
everything.

Secondary fire zooms in smoothly completely,
and almost instantly.
