The flamethrower is great for pushing the
enemy back or clearing out tight areas. This
weapon will light those it comes into contact
with long enough on fire. Once lit your victim 
must either get to water, or wait for the flames to 
go out on their own, the choice is his. In tight
quarters, the effects of the flamethrower will
increase since it will be "contained" by the walls
and the intensity of the heat will be significantly 
higher.

There is no secondary fire.
