Flares with Launcher

Flares are great for lighting up darkness. Toss 
one, and the area be lit up. They are nice for marking 
entrances to your base so people can't sneak in through
the darkness, and are also great for diversionary
tactics.

Caution: Contact with people will set them on
fire, so please use them carefully.
