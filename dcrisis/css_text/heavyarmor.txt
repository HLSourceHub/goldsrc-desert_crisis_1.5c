Heavy armor is the ultimate in modern protection, 
and the most armor any sane person would want to 
wear. Those in the armor can sustain a large amount
of damage even before they start feeling it.

Unfotunately, the tremendous weight of such armor
causes the user to move very slowly, leaving
more vulnerable parts of the body, such as the
head, easy targets for accurate weapons.
