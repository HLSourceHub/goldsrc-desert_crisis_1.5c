Infrared Goggles

These are great for dark areas where the enemy
is hard to see. Active them with your
flashlight key, and all people and hot objects
will be instantly lit up with a bright red
color.

These slowly drain your energy, so watch your
meter closely. Running out in the middle of
a battle could prove fatal.
