Katana

Damage: Medium

The traditional weapon of the Samurai, and a
common weapon on the battlefield of the
future. Forged with modern alloys and
sharpened with modern techniques, these blades
have proven themselves very useful in 
hand-to-hand combat.

Secondary attack will throw the sword, which
can cause damage to an enemy who is just out
of your reach. But be careful, because they can 
pick the sword up easily if you miss, leaving you
without one.
