Knife

Damage: Low

The standard issue knife of the recent world
conflicts. It's light and fast, great for
hitting other fast enemies. Good for both
slashing and throwing, it's the most versatile
of the melee weapons.

Secondary attack will throw the knife a good
distance for a large amount of damage if it
hits.
