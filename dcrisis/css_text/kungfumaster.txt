Kung-fu Master

Bonuses:
-Increased Adrenaline
-Attack while dashing
-Increased Melee Damage
-Free throwing knives

Restrictions:
-None

When ammo runs out, hand-to-hand fighting
becomes the name of the game. Those with 
Kung-fu Master get a bonus to their melee
attack damage, as well as the ability to attack
with a melee weapon while dashing. Dashing
attacks are something everyone else won't be 
able to do, giving Kung-fu Masters a great 
advantage.
