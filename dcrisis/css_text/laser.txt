C-14 Laser Pistol

Ammo Capacity: 5-6 blasts per charge
Rate of Fire: Fast Semi-Auto
Damage: Medium-High

The Laser Pistol fires laser blasts, and can 
be charged by holding the fire button for shots 
that do more damage. It also doesn't have ammo 
but a charge bar in place of clips. This gun is 
reasonably accurate.

Picking up a second laser pistol off the
ground will complete an akimbo set, allowing
the user to wield both at once.

Changing modes will switch between akimbo and
a single pistol. Akimbo pistols charge the bar
faster than a single pistol, but a single pistol 
has greater accuracy. Both will only
charge while deployed.
