X-1 Laser Assault Rifle

Ammo Capacity: 20 pulse, or 5 seconds of stream
Rate of Fire: 600 PPM, or continuous beam
Damage: Medium

The latest addition to the modern battlefield is
the X-1 Laser Assault Rifle (or LAR), a multiple 
purpose assault rifle that doesn't use conventional 
ammunition. Instead, it uses a high powered laser 
with devastating consequences.

Primary attack is a laser pulse, doing damage
to a large area with consecutive laser pulses.
Switching weapon modes allows the the LAR to fire
several beams at once in a blast, much like a 
shotgun.

Secondary attack is a continuous beam that does
extra damage to your targets head.
