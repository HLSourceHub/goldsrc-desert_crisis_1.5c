M79 Grenade Launcher

Ammo Capacity: 1 Shell
Rate of Fire: 1 Shot per reload
Damage: High w/ spread

The M79 40mm grenade launcher is great
for suppressive fire or clearing out those
enemy bunkers. Don't count on having the
grenades sail forever though, as they have a
limited range. Also, one should be careful
where he fires, as the grenades can kill the 
wielder too.

Primary fire fires shells which explode on 
contact, and secondary is a three second timed 
grenade.
