H&K MP5K

Clip size: 15 Rounds
Rate of Fire: 800 RPM
Damage: Low

A great SMG, it is fast and deadly. Effective 
for spraying and praying, it has a relatively 
quick reload, so the spraying is only shortly 
interrupted.

Picking up a second mp5k off of the ground will
complete an akimbo set, allowing the user to
wield both at once.

Changing modes switches between which mp5k(s)
you have out. Both mp5k's need ammo to fire
in akimbo mode.
