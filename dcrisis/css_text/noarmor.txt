No Armor

Protection: None
Speed: Very Fast

Restrictions:
-No Tech Guru

No armor is used when one must be as agile and 
quick as possible. Although you will be quick in 
life, you will be quick in death too. Being 
completely void of armor means you can take very 
little damage before dying. You are vulnerable to
automatic weapons or near misses from explosives.

It's great for getting to the fighting quickly, but
bad for staying in the middle of it.
