Sig P226s

Clip Size: 9 Rounds
Rate of Fire: Fast, semi-auto
Damage: Medium

The Sig has quite a  fast rate of fire but 
is not as deadly as the Desert Eagle or Raging 
Bull. It is fairly accurate though, which 
makes up for it's lack of damage. Headshots are 
the key to success when using this gun.

Picking up a second Sig P226 off of the ground
will complete an akimbo set. Allowing the user
to wield both at once.

Changing modes switches between which p226(s)
one has out. Each p226 has an independent
clip, which can be used to ones advantage.
