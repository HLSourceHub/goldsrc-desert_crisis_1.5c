Akimbo Sig P226s

Clip Size: 9 Rounds X 2
Rate of Fire: Fast Semi-Auto
Damage: Medium

The Sig has quite a  fast rate of fire but 
is not as deadly as the Desert Eagle or Raging 
Bull. It is fairly accurate though, which 
makes up for it's lack of damage. Headshots are 
the key to success when using this gun.

Secondary fire will fire BOTH pistols at once, 
but extra time will be needed before firing the 
next shot.

Changing modes switches between which p226(s)
one has out. Each p226 has an independent
clip, which can be used to ones advantage.
