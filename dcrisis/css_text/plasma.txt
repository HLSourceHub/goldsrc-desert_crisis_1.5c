C-37 Plasma Cannon

Ammo Capacity: 7 Blasts or 4 seconds of stream
Rate of Fire: 40 Blasts per minute
Damage: Very High w/ Spread

The plasma cannon fires super heated gas in
either a concentrated blast, or a stream.
When a concentrated blast is fired, the plasma
streaks towards it's point of impact and
explodes. One must be VERY careful as ones own
plasma rifle can easily overheat and explode,
killing the wielder.

Secondary fire ejects a stream of plasma which
is great for close ranges but causes very rapid
heat buildup, so be careful.
