C-22 Pulse Rifle

Clip Size: 45 Rounds
Rate of Fire: 1000 RPM
Damage: Low

Another great multi-purpose gun is the Pulse
Rifle. This is a machine gun and a grenade launcher 
in one firearm. The Pulse Rifle can only fire in fully 
automatic mode; there is no single shot or three round
burst mode. The advantage is the built in grenade 
launcher. Press secondary fire and watch your enemies 
explode. 

Once again, be careful because this gun can
be worthless in the hands of a newbie.
Sustained fire will greatly reduce it's
accuracy, so shorter bursts are essential for
efficient use.
