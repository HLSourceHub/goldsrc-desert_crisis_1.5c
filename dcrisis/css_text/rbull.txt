Raging Bull Model 444

Clip Size: 6 Rounds
Rate of Fire: Slow Semi-Auto
Damage: Very High

With very high damage and very 
accurate when fired singlely, this may be
the most deadly of the pistols. The drawbacks 
are a slow rate of fire and small clip.

Picking up a second Raging Bull off the
ground will complete an akimbo set, allowing
the user to wield both at once.

Changing modes switches between which Raging
Bull(s) one has out. Each Raging Bull has an
independent clip, which can be used to ones
advantage.
