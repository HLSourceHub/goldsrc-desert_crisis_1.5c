Sharpshooter

Bonuses:
-Aiming
-Free IR Goggles
-Passive accuracy increase

Restrictions:
-No special moves (dashing, walljumps, flips)

With increased training comes increased
accuracy. Sharpshooters spend hours per day
honing their aiming skills in hopes of someday
getting to use them in battle. Unfortunately, all
of this aiming practice has left their bodies
weak, and unable to the do athletic moves of
other soldiers.

Aiming is activated by pressing your item key.
You will gain perfect accuracy for a short
period, but you will not be able to maintain that
level of concentration long, so aim quickly.
