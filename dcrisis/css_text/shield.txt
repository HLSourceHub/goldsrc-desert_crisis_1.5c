Personal Defense Shield

Bonuses:
-Increased melee damage with shield on
-Protection from headshots with shield

Restrictions:
-None

A shield to provide extra protection for the
modern soldiers in the US Army. It is great for
staying alive without having to be slowed down
by big bulky armor, and it slowly regenerates
when the shield is turned off.

Active the shield with your item key. It
passively drains energy while on, so don't
turn it on unless you need it. While the shield
is up, damage will be dealt to your perk energy
instead of your armor and life.
