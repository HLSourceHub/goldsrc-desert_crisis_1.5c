Shoulder-Mounted Multipurpose Assault Weapon

The SMAW is a single shot rocket launcher.

It is a great tool for sending a present, in 
the form of a rocket, to some snipers or other
enemies out of the reach of normal grenades.
One has to be pretty accurate when firing to kill
a stationary target, and predicting where your 
target will move to is essential to hit enemies on
the run.

Secondary attack is a built-in zoom feature for
dealing with those enemies that are far away.
