Franchi Spas 12

Ammo Capacity: 8 Shells
Rate of Fire: ~60 RPM
Damage: Ranged

The Franchi Spas is the good ol' shotgun. 
Changing the firing mode will switch to 
a braced mode. The gun fires a slightly 
smaller spread while braced but has a
longer wait between shots.

For the Spas 12 to do considerable damage,
one needs to relatively close to his victim.
