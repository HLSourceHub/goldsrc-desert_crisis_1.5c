Throwing Knifes

Damage: High

The throwing knives are small knifes which 
where designed for throwing. You have
the option of throwing 1 or 3 knives. Change
this by pressing your weapon mode key.

Throwing one knife at a time goes much farther
than throwing three. However, the spread of
three knives makes it much easier to hit
enemies that are at point blank range.
