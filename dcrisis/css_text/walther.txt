USP Match 9mm

Clip Size: 15 Rounds
Rate of Fire: Fast Semi-Auto
Damage: Low

The USP Match has a fast rate of fire but 
is not as deadly as the other pistols. This 
gun is fairly accurate though, which makes up 
for its lack of damage. The silencers slightly 
reduce the accuracy though, so it's not as 
accurate as the P226. Headshots are still the 
key to success.

Picking up a second USP off of the ground will 
complete an akimbo set, allowing the user
to wield both at once.

Changing modes switches between which
USP(s) one has out. Each USP has an
independent clip, which can be used to ones
advantage.
