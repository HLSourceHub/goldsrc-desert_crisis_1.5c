Akimbo USP Match 9mm's

Clip Size: 15 Rounds X 2
Rate of Fire: Fast Semi-Auto
Damage: Low

The USP Matches have a fast rate of fire but 
are not as deadly as the other pistols. These 
guns are fairly accurate though, which makes up 
for their lack of damage. The silencers slightly 
reduce the accuracy though, so they are not as 
accurate as the P226s. Headshots are still the 
key to success.

Secondary fire will fire BOTH pistols but
requires extra time between shots.

Changing modes switches between which
USP(s) one has out. Each USP has an independent
clip, which can be used to ones advantage.
