Wootastic

Bonuses:
-Increased Adrenaline
-Unlimited pistol ammo

Restrictions:
-Only pistols
-No medium or heavy armor

You get no primary weapon, but you get akimbo
pistols which have unlimited ammo but slightly 
reduced damage. You also have extra adrenaline 
points and special moves (except for dashing) 
are enhanced. Longer and higher flips and better wall 
jumps are the result. Wootastic doesn't use an 
equipment choice to get akimbo pistols. One must 
wear light armor, or no armor to use this perk.
