                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">UP-KO (United Peace-Keeping
                Organization) was dedicated to bringing order and prosperity to
                the world. In their struggles for peace they began gathering the
                worlds greatest minds to create &quot;weapons of peace&quot;
                with which they planned to help resolve issues and protect the
                weak. The organization was a great success and peace soon spread
                the globe.&nbsp; As the years passed UP-KO began to create
                trouble. Where they once stood for peace, small factions within
                the organization began using their technology to bring
                themselves further power and strength. They forced scientists to
                help them create new weapons and began to fight amongst
                themselves. UP-KO began to lose membership from small countries
                who felt they were being pushed around.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
                this point the united leaders turned against the very vocal
                United States. President Wilson Bernhardt had begun to publicly
                accuse powerful members of UP-KO of treason and acts against
                humanity. Being one of the largest members of UP-KO, and one of
                the most influential, these actions led to open revolt as people
                began to rally and strike back against UP-KO. The organization
                was in trouble...</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
                a few months the US broke off from UP-KO and declared openly
                that no more selfish actions would be tolerated. This caused
                more countries to abandon UP-KO until it basically became a
                conglomerate of European, Middle Eastern and Asian forces. Now
                on the brink of war the two sides have abandoned global weapons
                in their conflict fearing MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) if
                they used these weapons.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Rising from the ashes of the crisis, the Scourge of the Desert
                (otherwise known as the &quot;Scorpion's Sting&quot;) began
                their crusade towards peace. Funded by untold millions, this
                group of freedom fighters believes that neither side cares for
                true peace and fight to liberate themselves and their brethren.
                The Scourge have freed hundreds of scientists and researchers
                from the clutches of UP-KO and have found themselves powerful
                allies. Amassing quite exclusive advances in cybernetic
                prosthesis they have become a force to reckon with.&nbsp;</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                world now is truly at war as everyone claims to be fighting for

                strike back with their remaining nuclear arsenal two days later.
                Approximately fifteen warheads were fired in this period, the
                Israeli and Egyptian forces are devastated. Nearby country's are
                harmed greatly due to the fallout and the massive increase in
                refugees. Combat ceases between Israeli and Egyptian forces who
                are now busy trying to save their countries.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2024 - Russia develops plasma
                weapon technology, it is highly unstable at the time. Russia
                sells this technology to the a variety of European countries.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2025 - The world's oil supply
                is almost entirely exhausted, American scientists make massive
                profits off of building fusion reactors all over the world for
                massive fees. Protests over this price gouging are heard all

                the &quot;European Alliance&quot;, effectively one country. All
                protests are silenced swiftly by agents of unknown affiliation.
                No documentation of these protests ever appear in any mainstream
                media outlet. Underground rumors state that this is the working
                of the Illuminati.&nbsp;</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2032 - A Russian chemical and
                Biological weapons facility is raided by an unknown group and
                every person there is killed. A multitude of weapons and virii
                are missing. Very few are ever recovered, paranoia rises
                worldwide as security precautions rise to unheard of heights.
                Later that year an entire town is exposed to a psychotropic
                agent in their water supply and goes insane. Thousands are put
                in mental institutions.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2034 - Nuclear war breaks out
                between Pakistan and India, the damage is minor compared to the
                Egypt/Israel nuclear exchange, but this causes vast amounts of
                fallout to fall across the globe.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2035 - The environment begins
                to falter significantly, temperatures are rising noticeably each
                year. The rain forests are almost entirely stripped. Protesters
                march in the streets of London for three days. The head of a
                logging company in Brazil is murdered and found nailed to a tree
                with his flesh removed. In his hands is a message that reads,

                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2039 - Anti-gravity technology
                is unveiled in Germany by a small research team. The team
                disappears three weeks later and their entire research facility
                is found empty. There is no evidence as to what happened to
                them. Buenos Aires is abandoned after a terrorist attack with a
                biological weapon, over 50,000 people die from its effects. The
                attack was credited to an organization called &quot;Bringers de
                La Entropía&quot;, dedicated to bringing chaos to the world.
                Disease begins to spread across South America, looting and
                violence ensues. Quarantines are placed in hundreds of areas in
                South America.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2040 - The European nations
                encourage the world to form a new organization dedicated to
                bringing peace. Meanwhile, conflict continues in the Middle
                East, which is now in a massive recession due to the oil
                shortage and the perseverance of war.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2042 - The United States
                unveils energy shield technology. At first this is used
                primarily on fighter jets, but it is soon adapted for squad
                combat.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2044 - The cure is found for
                the epidemic in South America. European agents distribute the
                vaccine. Some of the countries are so grateful that they join
                the European Alliance, vowing to uphold worldwide peace.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2045 - The European Alliance
                becomes the &quot;United Peace-Keeping Organization&quot;,
                dedicated to peace, prosperity and justice. A multitude of
                countries join the organization, only Russia,&nbsp; Brazil,&nbsp;
                Japan, India and Australia do not join (as well as a few smaller
                countries). Peace spreads the globe as conflict in the Middle
                East has finally come to what seems to be an end. Technology is
                shared freely among UP-KO nations and economic recessions become
                a thing of the past. Fusion power permeates the world and the
                energy crisis is solved.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2047 - UP-KO scientists unveil
                the first power armor suits. Using miniature fusion reactors and
                reinforced light-weight alloys, they are the most advanced
                personal protection systems to date. UP-KO squads are using this
                technology within the year. Some of the models incorporate
                anti-gravity technology.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2048 - All of the remaining
                smaller countries, India, Brazil and Australia&nbsp; join UP-KO
                due to their economies faltering and terrorist attacks on their
                relatively unguarded nations. None of these terrorist attacks
                are ever credited to any known organizations. Laser weapon
                technology is deployed among UP-KO units which was recently
                refined by Chinese UP-KO scientists. Russia and Japan remain
                separate from UP-KO.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2049 - Unknown terrorist
                attacks increase on Russia and Japan, rumors spread about
                UP-KO's involvement in these attacks. Sporadic strikes against
                UP-KO are reported across the world. An UP-KO research facility
                in Sweden is assaulted, forty scientists are missing as well a
                large amount of classified technology.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2051 - The covert assaults
                against UP-KO by this unknown organization continue as people
                begin to doubt UP-KO's power. A few news reports get out on an
                &quot;Operation Black Shield&quot; in which UP-KO agents invaded
                Moscow and assassinated various government agents in hopes of
                persuading Russia to join the organization due to their lack of
                security. Russia becomes enraged and calls for countries to
                leave the corrupt organization, UP-KO says it was an isolated
                incident and was not authorized by the head UP-KO officials.&nbsp;</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2052 - An UP-KO base in Iran
                is attacked and destroyed. Burned into the roof of the facility
                is the logo of a scorpion. Reports are released across the world
                about the organization that is now known as the &quot;Scourge of
                the Desert&quot;. Details are sketchy and no one is able to find
                where this organization is based. Two months later, a city in
                Japan is attacked for &quot;treason against UP-KO&quot; by
                UP-KO, a force of SotD shows up within hours and defends the
                city successfully. It is unclear how UP-KO was defeated, large
                squads are found dead without a single shot fired from their
                weapons. Japan and Russia proclaim their appreciation for the
                SotD's efforts against UP-KO. The United States breaks off from
                UP-KO and President Wilson Bernhardt publicly announces that he
                believes UP-KO is a corrupt and vile organization run by
                conspirators interested in nothing but advancing their own
                agendas. Two days later there is an attempted assassination of
                the President, Canada secedes from UP-KO that same day. Canada
                then joins the USA to create the &quot;American Block&quot;, a
                new force opposed to UP-KO's way of ruling the world.</font>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2053 - Violence erupts
                worldwide as the American Block and UP-KO clash. USA raids UP-KO
                bases worldwide in a campaign to bring down UP-KO. UP-KO ramps
                up its research in order to overcome USA through force and
                technology. A weapons manufacturing facility in Connecticut is
                destroyed by the SotD and melted into a metal wall is the
                message, &quot;Cease the destruction.&quot; A variety of
                countries split off from UP-KO and request the protection of the
                American Block This is the current time in which DC takes place.</font>

                Alliance soon began incorporating other countries promising an
                end to the violence. In 2045, the European Alliance was renamed
                the &quot;United Peace-Kepping Organization&quot; and spread
                faster than ever before. UP-KO's technology is some of the best
                in the world, with power armor, anti-gravity, plasma weapons,
                laser weapons, and even portable railguns. At present time,
                UP-KO is primarily composed of the European, African, Asian and
                South American nations. They are by far the most powerful
                organization in the world, but their influence is beginning to
                falter as more and more countries break off. The European

                Formed in 2052 when the USA and Canada both broke off from

                world working as hard as they can to develop new weapons and

                first founded in 2033 by a group of Egyptian cybernetics
                researchers, and their first known action was the slaying of a
                logging company leader in Brazil. The organization did not
                become publicly known until 2052 when they destroyed an UP-KO
                base in Iran. The Scourge of the Desert has many exclusive
                technological advances. Many of SotD's researchers are
                scientists liberated from UP-KO's tyrannical grip. The SotD has
                near exclusive advances in cybernetic prosthesis and cloaking.
                The SotD strives to end world conflict and believes that both
                UP-KO and the American Block are doing nothing but causing
                violence. The SotD's tactical strikes are aimed at stopping
                their military forces and preventing global destruction. The
                organization is very secretive and has never had a single agent
                captured alive. The organization is very rigid and to an
                outsider it would seem religious in its rituals.</font>

                soldier on the field is cybernetically enhanced to at least some
                extent. Their cybernetic enhancements include, but are not
                limited to: cybernetic endoskeletons, enhanced eyes that
                interface with custom weapons to allow &quot;smart aiming&quot;
                (as well as multiple vision modes on the fly), retractable

                in 2052. Japan's forces are small but highly trained, and have
                weapons such as ion cannons and sonic weaponry. Japan also has
                armor technology that rivals UP-KO's power armor, being far

                Crisis (DC) is a fun oriented Half-Life mod set in the close
                future. Realism definitely is not its main goal. Thus it's no
                surprise it features today's weapons (H&amp;K, Sig, etc.) as
                well as e.g. laser pistols and plasma cannons. The same applies
                to the perks. These are abilities the players can choose from as
                part of a character selection menu that is very similar to the
                system heroes are generated by at some pen and paper RPG's.<br>
                <br>
                This way it's possible to apply gaming styles different as day
                and night. While one player might choose no armor, enhanced
                melee powers, and a sledge hammer as main weapon the next one
                possibly goes for a very heavy suit, shield system, minigun
                combination. The &quot;ninja&quot; would then try to use his
                swiftness to attack the &quot;tank&quot; before the shields were
                up and the gun was firing massive amounts of slugs. It's one of
                DC's most remarkable accomplishments that both players have the
                same chances to be victories over each other. Nevertheless not
                all possibilities are equally easy to master especially since
                different players bring different skills and experiences with
                them.<br>
                <br>
                To become good or even an expert in DC one first has to realize
                certain basics (of which there are quite a lot) and then needs
                to employ them through training. By the time one feels he got
                everything he can be pretty sure though that he forgot or lacks
                the practice concerning something he once used to know and be
                able to do. As a result the learning process has no end to it
                and often players specialize themselves over time. Working
                together these specialists can form crews that have what it
                takes to be successful in DC: calm cappers, tech gurus to
                activate short cuts, warriors to cover and defend them, as well
                as some lone mad men quick and skillful enough to be behind the
                enemies - always. Fortunately the common two or three gamers per
                server that join to just frag as much as possible are only
                seldomly needed to decide which team wins.<br>
                <br>
                While there also are pure death match maps with limited respawns
                per player, usually DC maps either have a system of capture
                points to battle over or have multiple mission goals. A nice
                example is a map with a research facility which one team defends
                while the attacking team needs to destroy a satellite dish, to
                then capture a security computer, and steal a secret weapon. The
                design of the maps paces up the whole game even more as there
                hardly are any camping sites at all but a lot of possible hot
                spots. Basically all positions can be reached from at least two
                different directions. Wall jumps, dashing, and flip jumps
                guarantee three dimensional movement of the finest kind. On the
                other hand DC requires amazingly few keys compared to the
                possibilities offered to the users .<br>
                <br>
                In a nut shell DC simply shows how much thought and work has
                been put into it. After all, how many mods are out there that
                actually took care of details like customizable heads, at least
                two ways most weapons can be used, detachable limbs, or small
                porn pictures on the capture points' displays?<br>
