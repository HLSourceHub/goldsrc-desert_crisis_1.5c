Outside the ArmsTech Research Headquarters, UP-KO is preparing an attack on the USA owned company to steal a CD with data on it vital for the creation of a new type of weapon. As storms reign overhead, the USA troops must stand their round and prevent UP-KO from stealing the precious disc.

UP-KO: Disable both East and West Security terminals to open all secure doors. Then, re-wire the Circuit Panel on the 2nd floor to allow access to the Data CD on the third floor. Return the Data CD to your intrusion point.

USA: Defend the CD, thereby preventing UP-KO from obtaining the data necessary to create a new type of weapon.
