Countryside is set in a town in the outskirts of France. The USA
is trying to repel the UP-KO forces that have occupied the town.

USA: After important targets were bombed you have been sent
to take this town which is a strategic point in recapturing 
your French allies capitol.  Your objective is to capture in
order the Crossways, Grassy Knoll, Plaza, and Gothic Church by
"using" laptops at each point.

in the French countryside.
