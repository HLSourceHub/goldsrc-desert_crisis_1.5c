Kinetica is a map set in a city environment. USA is
trying to infiltrate an UP-KO skyscraper and steal
weapon's technology. Unfortunately, there is a security
radar system involving radar systems with a satellite uplink,
and a series of SAMs defending the building. This means
that USA has to go an alternate route.

First, USA must turn off the energy shields protecting the
satellites (UP-KO can turn these BACK on), then if the shields
are off, they can destroy the uplink satellites. Next, they must
secure a nearby club as a base of operations (do this by standing
on the DJ stand). Once that is taken care of, the generator for
the SAM site must be disabled so the SAMs can be disabled. After
that, the skyscraper is approachable, and USA must get the weapon
at the top. To get up to the top, USA has to disable the security
so the elevators will work, UP-KO can turn this security back on.
Once USA has the weapon, they win.

For UP-KO to win the map, they have to hold off USA, some of the previously
mentioned objectives are reversible, so be sure to take that into
account.
