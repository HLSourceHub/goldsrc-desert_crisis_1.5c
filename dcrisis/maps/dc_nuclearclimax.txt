After months of war, covert special operations team from both UP-KO and USA are closing in
on one of the few remaining nuclear missile silos. Both forces plan to use this missile to
strike against one another, but who will be the final target? While both teams try to launch
the missile, they must be wary of the other team who is trying to do the same. 

The objective in this map is to turn on the fuel, power, upload the software, select a target,
and then to launch the missile. Yet the target of the nuke can be changed in the time it takes
for the weapon to be launched, so your team must be wary of the progress and location of the other
team.
