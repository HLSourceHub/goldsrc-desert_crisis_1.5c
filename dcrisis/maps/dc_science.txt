The United States is attacking a secret UP-KO research facility in the hopes
of seizing secret weapons technology from the facility. Yet UP-KO is prepared
for such an event, and the defense force is striking back.

USA: First you must use the the helicopter or boat to gain access to the island.
Then you must destroy the satellite uplink for the security system, allowing access
to the research facility and shutting off the turrets. Once you have done this, you
must hack the security system at the front desk of the research facility and take
the weapon from the basement to the USA spawn. The security system can be hacked after
the weapon is taken, but the door to the vault is unlocked, making it easier to get the
weapon if the security is hacked. There is also an alternate path to the basement that techs
can blow open.

UP-KO: Prevent the USA team from destroying the satellite, hacking the security, and 
stealing the weapon from the research facility.
