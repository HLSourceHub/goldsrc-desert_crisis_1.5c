This is a small team deathmatch map. It is best
with 4-8. This is a map set on an UP-KO anti-grav
propelled supply train headed towards a base in the
desert. USA is trying to hijack it.

Objectives: Kill the people that don't look like
you. :D

This map is played in rounds (the players become spectators
when they die 3 times, they are spectators until the round 
restarts).
